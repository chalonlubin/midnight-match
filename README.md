# Midnight Match

A Halloween themed matching game - _refactor is WIP on seperate branch._ 

[demo](https://chalonlubin.github.io/midnight-match/) Deployed with Github pages. 

## 🧐 Motivation & Challenges

> This was my second ever project, the original code is poorly written. I have since started to refactor to utilize OOP on another branch other than main, utilizing an API to populate the images. I enjoyed this project when I first attempted it, and I have also enjoyed the refactor. Games are a great way to build skills in login.
